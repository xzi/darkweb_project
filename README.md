## Disclaimer
This is a school project made for fun by a group of friends. This is not a serious guide to the dark web and should not be treated as such. If you are interested in actual proper resources on the topic, I recommend checking on Dread and the side of the internet itself. Books are never a replacement for experience.  

Additionally, ***no one on our team condones breaking the law, drug use, or bad things in general***. We simply believe that knowledge is power and in the free exchange of information.  

Tl;dr Do not take this seriously please don't take us down Github thanks xo

    <p>Note: These notes are extremely corny and I would not recommend reading them. I just have them down here so I can reference back when I get off of EVE long enough to actually write this thing.  </p>
    <p>Remember kids, it&#39;s a hobby, not an addiction. </p>

            <p>&quot;The deep web is defined as the internet section that is not indexed by web crawlers. The dark web, on the other hand, is defined as a subsegment of the deep web that can be accessed only with special tools. While the former is used chiefly for legitimate day-to-day online activities, the latter is more anonymous and known for illegal transactions.&quot;</p>

            <p>Freenet was created in 2000 by a university student at the University of Edinburgh named Ian Clarke. The goal of Freenet was to be a &quot;Distributed Decentralised Information Storage and Retrieval System&quot; (geek talk for Internet). This was used as the base for the Tor Project which came around in 2002 and is generally what people think of when they hear the words &quot;Dark web&quot;.  </p>

            <h1 id="accessing-the-dark-web">Accessing the dark web</h1>
            <p>There are a few different versions of the dark web however the most famous is Tor. Accessing Tor is as simple as downloading the Tor Browser and installing it to your computer. From there, you can access sites on the Tor network. Other dark webs such as I2P require their own browsers and protocols to access.  </p>

            <p>If you don&#39;t know what you are looking for? Not a lot. If you know what you are looking for, then you know what to expect. The dark web is just another internet and as such, it&#39;s not too far off of what you would imagine goes on that you can see.  </p>

            <p>Dark.fail is known as a highly reputable link site for the dark web. It contains links to 34 different sites ranging from mirrors of government websites to Reddit clones to legal XXX material (maybe don&#39;t include that part?).   </p>

            <p>Dread is one of the most famous sites on the Dark web. In essence, it is a Reddit clone that can be used for discussion of almost anything. The only things that are not allowed to be discussed are:  </p>
            <hr>
            <ul>
            <li>Pro-terrorism or terrorist propaganda</li>
            <li>Harmful weapons/weapons of mass destruction</li>
            <li>Poisons</li>
            <li>Assassination services or media related to harm/murder</li>
            <li>Doxxing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite the potential for a lot of very nasty discussion to go on with the minimal moderation stance the staff takes, I saw next to none of what most would call &quot;unacceptable behavior&quot;. Most users were very civil and having discussions on topics that interested them or they wanted more info on.  </p>
            <p>Dread is also the #1 place on the dark web to advertise your criminal goods and services, however we will get back to that.  </p>

        <h1>Deep web vs Dark web</h1>
        <p>"The deep web is defined as the internet section that is not indexed by web crawlers. The dark web, on the other hand, is defined as a subsegment of the deep web that can be accessed only with special tools." - Spiceworks</p>

        <h1>Brief History</h1>
        <p>Freenet was created in 2000 by a university student at the University of Edinburgh named Ian Clarke. The goal of Freenet was to be a "Distributed Decentralised Information Storage and Retrieval System" (geek talk for Internet). This was used as the base for the Tor Project which came around in 2002 and is generally what people think of when they hear the words "Dark web".  </p>

        <h1>Accessing The Dark Web</h1>
        <p>There are a few different versions of the dark web however the most famous is Tor. Accessing Tor is as simple as downloading the Tor Browser and installing it to your computer. From there, you can access sites on the Tor network. Other dark webs such as I2P require their own browsers and protocols to access.</p>

        <h1>dark.fail</h1>
        <p>https://dark.fail/</p>
        <p>darkfailenbsdla5mal2mxn2uz66od5vtzd5qozslagrfzachha3f3id.onion</p>
        <p>Dark.fail is known as a highly reputable link site for the dark web. It contains links to 34 different sites ranging from mirrors of government websites to Reddit clones</p>

        <h1>Dread</h1>
        <p>Dread is one of the most famous sites on the Dark web. In essence, it is a Reddit clone that can be used for discussion of almost anything.</p>
        <p>Despite the potential for a lot of very nasty discussion to go on with the minimal moderation stance the staff takes, I saw next to none of what most would call "unacceptable behavior". Most users were very civil and having discussions on topics that interested them or they wanted more info on.</p>
        <p>Dread is also the #1 place on the dark web to advertise your criminal goods and services (Note that nothing is permitted to be sold directly on Dread), however we will get back to that.</p>

        <h1>Distributed Denial of Secrets</h1>
        <p>https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Distributed_Denial_of_Secrets</p>
        <p>ddosxlvzzow7scc7egy75gpke54hgbg2frahxzaw6qq5osnzm7wistid.onion/wiki/Distributed_Denial_of_Secrets</p>
        <p>Distributed Denial of Secrets is a website known for hosting internet leaks. These range from drug busts to the no fly list. While the site itself is legal for the most part, it does have a TOR site for the paranoid.</p>

        <h1>The CIA's Website</h1>
        <p>https://cia.gov/</p>
        <p>ciadotgov4sjwlzihbbgxnqg3xiyrg7so2r2o3lt5wz5ypk4sxyjstad.onion</p>
        <p>The CIA hosts a TOR site for cia.gov. The primary use case for this is as an anonymous reporting.</p>
